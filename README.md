GMU MSSC Chatbot

## PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
Traditional AI chatbots, while effective in handling standard queries, often struggle with providing accurate, contextually relevant, and up-to-date responses. Their limitations become apparent in complex conversation scenarios, where nuanced understanding and real-time information retrieval are essential.

The primary challenge is to overcome the limitations of conventional AI chatbots by enhancing their capabilities through the integration of a Large Language Model (LLM) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This integration aims to address the following specific issues:

* Limited Contextual Understanding
* Static Knowledge Base
* Handling Complex Queries
* Personalization Deficit
* Scalability and Performance

## PROJECT GOALS
The overall project goal is to develop an AI chatbot that effectively integrates a LLM with RAG using AWS services to:

* Enhance contextual understanding and maintain coherence over longer conversation threads.
* Dynamically retrieve and incorporate up-to-date information from external sources in real-time.
* Accurately understand and respond to complex, nuanced queries.
* Offer personalized responses based on user interactions and preferences.
* Maintain high performance and scalability for handling concurrent interactions across various domains.
