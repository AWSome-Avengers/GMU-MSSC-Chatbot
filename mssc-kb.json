We will be happy to process your request if your application is eligible for deferral or reconsideration. Please keep in mind that not all programs offer automatic deferrals of admission and instead, some programs offer \"reconsideration\" of admission. In a reconsideration, a new application for the original program would need to be created and resent to the faculty for consideration. All deferrals and reconsideration processing is offered free of charge if you are eligible. If you are uncertain if your program offers a deferral or a reconsideration option, please email us at masongrad@gmu.edu.\n\nPlease keep in mind that the Office of Graduate Admissions is unable to drop you from your courses.

			"question": "QUESTION\nHow do I apply to Mason as a freshman?",
			"answer": "ANSWER\n\nYou apply to Mason using the Common Application or the Mason exclusive application. We do not prefer one application over the other. Your application will need to include four things: a completed application, the application fee or appropriate fee waiver, an official copy of your high school transcript, and your official or self-reported SAT or ACT scores, unless you apply Score Optional. A personal statement and letters of recommendation are optional, but strongly recommended. Students must submit an additional essay if they wish to be considered for the Honors College. The application and detailed admissions requirements are available online at\u00a0https://www2.gmu.edu/admissions-aid/how-apply/freshman.\u00a0\n\nThe admissions committee takes a holistic approach to\u00a0making decisions on applications, reviewing all components of each application thoroughly. High school curriculum and rigorous coursework, grades, grade trends, test scores (if applicable), and any supplemental information are considered. The median weighted GPA for freshmen admitted to Mason is between a 3.3-3.9. The median SAT score range for our admitted students is between 1100-1210, which is about a 23-29 composite on the ACT. These numbers, especially test scores, should never deter anyone from applying to Mason because of our holistic review process. Remember, we are Score Optional, so it is the applicant\u2019s choice whether to submit standardized test scores as a part of our admission process.",

Once the AIPC is received, you will know your application has been processed.\n\nIf the AIPC checklist item is marked as received in your Online Application Portal checklist, this means your application has undergone initial processing and any items that appear as \u201cnot received\u201d have either not been received or not yet been processed.\n\nPlease note that it can take a few business days for our office to review any newly received items, and therefore you may not see this item updated in your checklist right after submission.

			"question": "QUESTION\nGraduate Transcript Audit FAQ's:",
			"answer": "ANSWER\nAUDIT FAQs\nOffice of Graduate Admissions\n\nWhy do we audit? For compliance with George Mason University accreditation and admission standards, which requires official transcripts for a bachelor\u2019s degrees and higher (if applicable) for our enrolled students.\n\nWhat is required for the audit? An official transcript with the bachelor\u2019s degree conferral date and ANY other degree earned that is a bachelor\u2019s degree OR higher.\u00a0 Conferral date must be present on all transcripts. If a student graduated from Mason, Admissions will pull those transcripts - students do not need to request Mason transcripts.\n\nWhat is considered official and how may it be submitted? An official transcript sent from the undergraduate or graduate institution to Mason (electronically or through the mail) with the bachelor\u2019s or master\u2019s degree conferral date.\u00a0 Students may opt to have an official transcript mailed to them and then bring them to the Office of Admissions (JC 213) in the original sealed envelope from the undergraduate institution.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Electronic submissions should be sent to ugtrans@gmu.edu\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Postal Mail should be sent to: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nGeorge Mason University\nOffice of Graduate Admissions\nMSN-4C8- Final Transcript Submission\n4400 University Drive\nFairfax, VA 22030\n\n\nMultiple bachelor degrees earned?\u00a0 If you have earned two bachelor's degrees, we require the official transcript for both of those degrees. If you have earned a master\u2019s degree or doctorate, you must submit official transcripts for those as well.\n\nTranscripts for non-bachelor\u2019s degrees:\nFor the audit, do I need to submit official transcripts for schools where no degree was earned? NO\nFor the audit, do I need to submit official transcripts for my Associates degree? NO\nFor the audit, do I need to submit official transcripts for my Master\u2019s degree? YES\nFor the audit, do I need to submit official transcripts for my PhD? YES\n\nWill we return official transcripts? No. Per university policy, items submitted become university property and will not be returned.\n\nWhere can I look to see what transcripts have been submitted?\u00a0 You can log into the Online Application Portal to see if you have fulfilled the EXIT requirement.\u00a0 If you have, then you have exited the audit and we have received the necessary documents.\u00a0 If not, then you have not exited the audit.\n\nInternational Official Transcripts:\nOfficial documents are issued by the degree granting institution and bear the official seals and signatures of the Registrar, Controller of Examinations or other institutional authority. Official documents may be printed on original security paper or be stamped, signed or attested photocopies. Mason understands that, in some rare cases, universities issue only one set of originals, so copies are permitted as long as the attestations are original.\nInternational UNOFFICIAL transcripts (Not acceptable):\nUnattested photocopies, re-copied documents, scanned documents or documents attested or verified by local notaries.\nEnglish translations prepared by a non-recognized translator, or self-translated documents.\nTranscripts, mark sheets, degree certificates, diplomas, and English translations that are copied and have been opened by someone other than a Mason staff member.\n\nFor more details on international transcripts, you may visit: https://admissions.gmu.edu/documents/internationalTranscriptGuidelines.pdf\n\nWhen will the hold be placed? For the spring 2022 term, a hold will be placed on student records on April 4, 2022.\n\nWhat does a hold do? It prevents students from registering for classes for the next term or applying to graduate.\n\nHow is a hold removed? By submitting final, official transcripts to the Office of Graduate Admissions. We will manually remove your hold once those transcripts are processed; about 3-5 business after we receive them.\n\nWill I receive notification that the hold is removed? Yes, we will send out an email within 24 hours notifying you when the hold is removed and when you have exited the audit.",

These applicants include:\n\u00a0\n\nFreshman applicants who are eligible for ACT, NACAC, SAT, Free and Reduced Lunch Program (FRLP), or Fairfax College Partnership (FCPP) fee waivers. Waiver forms must be signed by your college counselor.\nFreshman applicants who are high school scholars and who have earned Mason college credit through attendance at Mason's Washington Scholar Programs: The Washington Journalism and Media Conference (WJMC) or The Washington Youth Summit on the Environment (WYSE).\nFreshman applicants who have participated in the Governor\u2019s School at Innovation Park are eligible for a fee waiver. Please note that it is ONLY for students at the Innovation Park Governor\u2019s School, not other Governor\u2019s Schools.\nFreshman applicants who are members of the Early Identification Program (EIP).\nParticipants of the Mason Dream Catchers program.\nTransfer applicants who are graduates of the Pathway to the Baccalaureate Program.\nTransfer applicants who are currently receiving a full PELL award at their current institution. Documentation showing full PELL is required to be eligible.\nGraduate, Non-Degree, and Transfer applicants that are full-time Mason faculty or classified staff.\nUnder the terms of the Senior Citizens Higher Education Act of 1974, eligible Virginia residents, 60 years or older with a taxable income of less than $23,850 may qualify for an application waiver.\n\n\nPlease note that many fee waivers require you to submit appropriate documentation.\u00a0\n\nYour eligibility for an application fee waiver is generally determined at the point of application.\u00a0Please be advised that if you are uncertain if you qualify for an application fee waiver, please contact the Office of Admissions at 703-993-2400 to seek guidance BEFORE you submit your application. Incorrectly indicating fee waiver eligibility will dramatically delay your application, and require you to pay the application fee before a decision can be made.",

			"question": "QUESTION\nWhat is non-degree graduate admissions?",
			"answer": "ANSWER\nNon-degree admission is a form of admission where a student will never, as the name suggest, be able to earn a degree in this status. A non-degree graduate student may enroll in both undergraduate and graduate courses. As long as a graduate non-degree student takes at least one course a semester, the student will retain graduate non-degree status and will not have to reapply as a non-degree student. If a graduate non-degree student fails to enroll in one class a semester, the student must reapply to non-degree studies, and be accepted, to maintain non-degree status. Non-Degree offers applicants the opportunity to take comprehensive, graduate-level courses without formally pursuing a degree. This option allows individuals who do not currently wish to pursue a degree, but are interested in taking competitive courses, access to skilled faculty, our excellent research facilities and the opportunity to get a jump start on a potential graduate program in the future. Applicants must present an earned baccalaureate degree from a regionally accredited college or university, or international equivalent, verified from official transcripts with a minimum 3.00 GPA on a 4.00 grade scale. Unfortunately, students on an F-1 visa are not eligible to apply for non-degree enrollment.",

			"answer": "ANSWER\nGeorge Mason University gives freshmen applicants the option to submit a personal statement of approximately 400 words that highlights either their leadership achievements or their significant service contributions to their high school or community. Students who wish to apply to the Honors College and/or University Scholars must submit a personal statement. Students can submit the personal statement online when prompted during the application process. If you have already submitted your application but would still like to turn in a personal statement, you can email the personal statement to the Office of Admissions at admissions@gmu.edu in a word document with your full name and G Number. Here are some helpful hints when crafting your personal statement:\n\n\u2022 Remember, the Admissions Committee wants to learn more about you. When preparing your personal statement, please take the opportunity to share information about yourself that cannot be found elsewhere on your application. The Committee is particularly interested in your leadership achievements or service contributions to your high school or community.\n\n\u2022 Please write your personal statement in Microsoft Word (or any other word processing application), perform a spell check, and save the final version as a plain text file. Saving the file this way will allow you to easily copy and paste it into the online application.\n\n\u2022 We discourage you from writing your personal statement in one sitting. Allow yourself ample time to draft and review your work before submitting your application.\n\n\u2022 Your personal statement must be your own original work. However, it is certainly acceptable to have someone else review and edit your personal statement or make suggestions concerning improvements you might make.",

It if is not possible for you to obtain official copies of your transcripts, or your university has a verified online policy of issuing only one copy of transcripts, you may do one of the following:\n\n\u2022 Best Option: You do not have to send official transcripts if you get the WES ICAP (http://www.wes.org/educators/icap.asp) evaluation sent directly to our office. If you do choose the WES ICAP as the credential evaluation, you will not need to send in a copy of official transcripts, as WES can attest your transcripts for you. This is only possible with the WES ICAP, and no other evaluation service.\n\n\u2022 Second Best Option: You may have your official transcripts attested by an embassy or consulate before submitting them.\n\n\u2022 Final Option: You may request an exception by sending an email to masongrad@gmu.edu with your request. In your email, ensure you detail why, referring the specific circumstance above, you are unable to get these documents, being sure to include your specific university name and country where this university is or was located.

			"question": "QUESTION\nI am applying to more than one graduate program. Do I have to submit everything, including transcripts and supplementary materials, for each application?",
			"answer": "ANSWER\nTest scores and transcripts are shared between graduate programs. However, due to the unique nature of each program, other supplementary materials are not shared. Each program may have different supplementary material requirements, such as extended goals statements, letters of recommendation, or a portfolio, therefore, in order to complete the requirements for each application, you will need to upload items each time you apply.\n\nThe Office of Graduate Admissions matches GRE/TOEFL scores to each application, provided you have had the scores sent to Mason's institution code (5827), so you will not have to resend scores if applying to multiple programs or if you have applied in the past.",

			"answer": "ANSWER\nIn order to submit your graduate application at Mason, we require just the basic application form and fee. However, in order to complete your application for review by our faculty for an admissions decision, you must upload all of the supplementary materials required by your program, such as a goals statement or writing sample. Once you submit your online application, within a few minutes our system will update your Self-Service Center with your program-specific supplemental material requirements so that you can finish uploading your materials. By being prepared to finish your application in one sitting, you\u2019ll save lots of time and can get your decision much faster.\n\nTo be prepared, first visit our Application Deadlines and Requirements section, https://www2.gmu.edu/admissions-aid/how-apply/graduate/application-deadlines-and-requirements, then read over our Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ\u2019s) at\u00a0https://www2.gmu.edu/admissions-aid/how-apply/graduate/frequently-asked-questions for information on uploading transcripts and more.\n\nIf your program requires letters of recommendation, we suggest you gather the emails and contact information for your recommenders before you sit down with the application as the online recommendation system is already built into the application and you must have that information to submit your application. We will not accept letters of recommendation outside of this online system except under extenuating circumstances. It is helpful for your recommenders to know of their role before receiving the recommendation request, and we encourage maintaining contact with them throughout the application process.",

			"answer": "ANSWER\nMason students participate in rigorous graduate coursework as part of their university educational experience. Therefore, students at Mason must have a full command of academic English at the graduate level in order to be successful throughout their studies. All new graduate students are expected to accurately comprehend written graduate-level English, clearly understand rapidly spoken English in classroom lectures and in professional settings, write with proper grammar and syntax, and be able to respond quickly in English using a vocabulary appropriate for collegiate settings.\n\nFor this reason, Mason has a high standard of English proficiency for graduate admission.\n\nMason strictly requires all students who have not earned bachelors, masters, or doctoral degree from a regionally accredited university in the United States, Canada (excluding province of Quebec), Commonwealth Caribbean (Antigua, Barbuda, Belize, Cayman Islands, Dominica, Guyana, Jamaica, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago), United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, or New Zealand to provide English proficiency scores. Regardless of citizenship or length of stay in the U.S., all international applicants not exempted from the countries above are required to take an English proficiency examination and meet minimum scores set by Mason in order to be considered for admission.\n\nThe TOEFL, Pearson Test of English, or IELTS exams can be used to meet this requirement. The university will not accept English-proficiency examination scores that are more than two years old. All scores must be sent directly to the Office of Admissions from the testing agency.\n\nTo view our English Proficiency policy in its entirety, please visit: https://www2.gmu.edu/admissions-aid/how-apply/graduate/standardized-test-information",

			"answer": "ANSWER\nAB (Absent from the Final Exam) A temporary grade of AB may be given to students with prior approval of their dean/director to be absent from the final examination.\n\nAU (Audit) In order to receive a grade of AU, students (unless they are a part of the Senior Citizen Waiver Program) are required to submit a Course Audit form.\n\nHC (Honor Code) Use this grade if an honor code violation is suspected and will be filed with the Dean of Students (Office of University Life). A special code NR (Not Reported) will appear on the student\u2019s record.\n\nIN (Incomplete) You may assign a grade of incomplete only if the student meets the catalog requirements for this grade. The University Catalog states: \u201cThe grade of IN may be given to a student who is passing a course but who may be unable to complete scheduled course work for a cause beyond reasonable control.\u201d An incomplete is a contract between the instructor and the student and should not be given unless pre-arranged. Work must be completed at the latest by the end of the ninth week of the next semester and grades submitted by the tenth week (not including Summer Term). Instructors may require a shorter deadline. In this instance, an Incomplete Grade Contract must be submitted.\n\nNA (Never Attended) Use if the student never attended the course. NA is an internal notation. The grade of F will appear on the student\u2019s transcript.\n\nSA (Stopped Attending) Use if the student stopped attending the course. You must give the last date of attendance in the \u2018Last Attend Date\u2019 field. SA is an internal notation. The grade of F will appear on the student\u2019s transcript.\n\nW (Withdrawal) If a student has been granted permission to withdraw and the withdrawal has been processed, you will see the grade of W recorded for the student on your roster.

A grade of IN should be given only in situations where the student, for reasons beyond their control, is not able to complete the coursework within the normal time span of the course.\n\nAn IP (In Progress) is appropriate for courses in which the student is expected to continue to develop their research, writing or project until a future semester, such as for a thesis or dissertation, a practicum or internship. The IP grade is available only for limited, pre-approved courses, most at the graduate level.

Transcripts may be uploaded directly in the application by the applicant. Unofficial copies of transcripts are acceptable for application review.

Score Optional review provides an opportunity for students to be considered for admission without submitting standardized test scores whether by choice or by necessity. If you are applying score optional, it is recommended that you maintain a competitive, cumulative high school grade point average for Score Optional consideration. If you have already taken an SAT or ACT and are unsure if you should include them with your application, you may send your test scores in. If the admissions committee determines your application is more competitive without your test scores, your application will be switched to Score Optional. Applying without test scores will not be detrimental to your application, and Score Optional students are reviewed for admission, merit scholarships, and the Honors College in an equal manner with those students who do submit test scores.\n\nDue to SAT and ACT test date cancellations, freshmen applicants to the Volgenau School of Engineering for the Spring 2021 and Fall 2021 terms are exempt from the 550 SAT MATH /24 ACT MATH requirement if they have taken or are currently enrolled in four years of high school mathematics classes, including a course beyond Algebra II by their senior year, and have achieved grades of B or better in each of those courses.",

			"question": "QUESTION\n\nHow should I report information about my noncitizen parents on the 2024\u201325 FAFSA form?",
			"answer": "ANSWER\n\nHere are some tips for students with noncitizen parents:\n\n\u00a0\n\nParents who don\u2019t have a Social Security number (SSN) will be able to create a StudentAid.gov account to access and complete their portion of your 2024\u201325 FAFSA form. (This applies for 2024\u201325 and future forms, not for 2023\u201324.)\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe SSN will be blank and disabled on the FAFSA form if the parent doesn\u2019t have an SSN. If the parent has an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN), they should add it to the FAFSA form. If they don\u2019t have an ITIN, they should leave that question blank.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIf your parent doesn't live in the U.S., they can select their country from the \u201cCountry\u201d dropdown menu.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIf your parent lives and files taxes in a foreign country and doesn\u2019t file U.S. taxes, they will still need to provide consent and approval. They will need to convert the amounts on the foreign tax return into U.S. dollars using the published exchange rate and manually enter their financial information from their most recent foreign tax return into the FAFSA form.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIf your parent lives in and files taxes with a U.S. territory or a Freely Associated State only, your parent should use the information from that tax return to fill out their section of the FAFSA form.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIf your parent lives in and files taxes with a U.S. territory or a Freely Associated State, and files a U.S. tax return, contact the financial aid office at the college or career/trade school you plan to attend to determine which tax forms and information your parents need to provide to accurately calculate your federal student aid eligibility.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIf your parent doesn\u2019t file taxes at all, they will be asked for information about how much they earned from work, rather than being asked for information about specific items on the tax form.",

			"question": "QUESTION\n\nIs my parent a contributor when I fill out my FAFSA form?",
			"answer": "ANSWER\n\nA graphic containing the same text below can be found\u00a0HERE.\n\n\u00a0\n\nA parent means your legal (biological or adoptive) parent or a person that the state has determined to be your legal parent. A stepparent is considered a parent if they have adopted you. Stepparents who have not adopted you will be identified as a parent spouse.\n\n\u00a0\n\n[Question 1] Are your biological or adoptive parents married to each other?\n\n\u00a0\n\n[Yes] Your parents\u2019 marital status is married (not separated), and both of your parents\u2019 information must be included on the FAFSA form. If your parents did not file taxes jointly, then both of your parents are contributors. Their individual information, consent and approval, and signatures will be required on the FAFSA form. If your parents filed taxes jointly, only one parent is required as a contributor and will report information for both parents.\n\n\u00a0\n\n[No, then answer question 2]\n\n\u00a0\n\n[Question 2] Do your biological or adoptive parents live together?\n\n\u00a0\n\n[Yes] Your parents\u2019 marital status is unmarried (both legal parents living together), and both of your parents are contributors, even if they were never married, are divorced, or are separated. Their individual information, consent and approval, and signatures will be required on the FAFSA form.\n\n\u00a0\n\n[No, then answer question 3]\n\n\u00a0\n\n[Question 3] Did one parent provide more financial support than the other over the past 12 months?\n\n\u00a0\n\n[Yes] The individual information, consent and approval, and signature of the parent who provided more financial support over the past 12 months will be required on the FAFSA form, and this parent will be identified as a contributor.\n\n\u00a0\n\n[No] The individual information, consent and approval, and signature of the parent who has the greater income or assets will be required on the FAFSA form, and this parent will be identified as a contributor.\n\n\u00a0\n\n[Question 4] Has this parent married/remarried?\n\n\u00a0\n\n[Yes] Your parent\u2019s marital status is married/remarried. Your stepparent will also be identified as a contributor on the FAFSA form if they didn\u2019t file their taxes jointly with your parent.\n\n\u00a0\n\n[No] Your parent\u2019s marital status is single (never married), separated, divorced, or widowed. An additional parent will not be identified as a contributor.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNote: Dependent students are required to report parent information on the FAFSA form, and in most cases, a parent will be identified as a contributor for these students. All contributors are required to provide their information, signature, and consent and approval to have their federal tax information transferred directly from the IRS into the FAFSA form. Being a contributor on the FAFSA form does not mean an obligation to pay for the student\u2019s education.\n\n\u00a0\n\nUpdated September 2023",

			"question": "QUESTION\n\nWhat changes were made to the FAFSA?",
			"answer": "ANSWER\n\nThe\u00a02024-2025 FAFSA opened on December 31, 2023. This date is different than past years when the FAFSA was available each year on October 1.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhat is Mason\u2019s 2024-2025 FAFSA priority deadline?\n\nNEW: For priority consideration of limited funding, undergraduate students must submit their 2024-2025 FAFSA by March 1, 2024.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen will Mason receive my submitted 2024-2025 FAFSA?\n\nThe Financial Aid Office will begin to receive 2024-2025 FAFSAs in early February.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhy did the FAFSA availability date change?\n\nOn Dec. 27, 2020, Congress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act which includes the FAFSA Simplification Act\u2014a sweeping redesign of the processes and systems used to award federal student aid. Specifically, the law makes it easier for students and families to complete and submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA\u00ae) form and expands access to federal student aid. Implementation of these changes to the FAFSA delayed the release of the annual form.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhile the 2024-2025 FAFSA is available on December 31, 2023, the period following Dec. 31, 2023 is a soft launch. This soft launch period will allow Federal Student Aid (FSA) to monitor and respond in real time to any potential issues impacting the FAFSA applicant experience. During this time applicants may experience a waiting room feature and/or delays which will help control website volumes to ensure optimal performance of the form.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Besides the FAFSA availability date, what else is changing?\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe term \u201cEFC\u201d (expected family contribution) is changing.\n\nWith the 2024-2025 FAFSA, the term Expected Family Contribution (EFC) will be replaced with the Student Aid Index (SAI) \u2013 this is a new need analysis formula that we will use when awarding need-based grants and scholarships.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNo benefit for having siblings in college\n\nThe FAFSA previously divided the EFC proportionally based on the number of the household in college. The elimination of this \"sibling discount\" will be the biggest change in aid eligibility for some students. As such, students with siblings in college may see a change in their aid eligibility, as well as, with the aid received by their sibling(s) at Mason or elsewhere. The determination to no longer consider number in college was made by Congress and can only be changed by Congress.\n\n\u00a0\n\nStreamlined application\n\nYou\u2019ll notice fewer questions when completing the 2024-2025 FAFSA and an easier way to transfer tax information directly from the IRS.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNew terminology\n\nYou\u2019ll notice a few new terms like contributor (anyone who is asked to provide information on the FAFSA, a parent or student spouse for example) and consent (each contributor will need to consent to their information being included on the FAFSA).\n\n\u00a0\n\nLearn more about the 2024-2025 FAFSA changes here.",

			"question": "QUESTION\nHow can I be considered for the VirginiaTwo-Year College Transfer Grant Program (CTG)?",
			"answer": "ANSWER\n\nVirginia Two-Year College Transfer Grant Program (CTG)\n\nUnder this program, qualifying undergraduate students who complete their Associate\u2019s Degree at a Virginia two-year public college and then transfer to a participating Virginia four-year college or university may be considered for the CTG award.\n\nHow Much Can A Student Receive?\n\nThis grant is awarded to students enrolled at participating four-year institutions\nMaximum annual standard award is $1,000 ($500 per term)\nAdditional $1,000 ($500 per term) for students enrolled in specific degree programs in: science, teaching, engineering, mathematics, or nursing\nAmount may be reduced if the new grant results in an over award\nState grant funds may be reduced if you receive a Transfer Grant\nAny CTG award may be reduced subject to funding availability and the anticipated number of eligible students\nA CTG award might be unavailable if a student\u2019s eligibility is confirmed after funds have been exhausted\nAny CTG award may be reduced if there is an over award (total financial assistance cannot be greater than the student\u2019s Cost of Attendance). Note that the CTG awards can affect eligibility for other need-based aid\n\n\nEligibility Information for the CTG\n\nA student must:\n\nBe a first-time entering freshman no earlier than fall 2007 (this refers to the first-time student is degree-seeking at any college)\nBe an undergraduate in-state student\nMeet selective service requirements\nHave received an Associate\u2019s degree at a Virginia two-year public institution, and submit a final academic transcript to the Admissions Office as soon as the Associate\u2019s degree is posted\nHave a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or greater on a scale of 4.0 for the Associate\u2019s degree\nEnroll full-time into a Virginia four-year public or Virginia four-year private nonprofit college or university by the fall or spring semester following completion of Associate\u2019s degree\nEnroll into a degree program not for religious training or theological education\nHave applied for financial aid by completing the\u00a0FAFSA\u00a0\u00a0by March\u00a01\nHave sufficient financial need: defined as a federally calculated Expected Family Contribution (EFC) of 12,000, or less\n\n\nTo be eligible for renewal of the grant for up to three years or 70 credit hours, a student must:\n\u00a0\n\nContinue to maintain a college GPA of at least 3.0 on a 4.0 scale\nContinue to demonstrate financial need and meet EFC requirements\nContinue to maintain\u00a0satisfactory academic progress\nAny break in eligibility after initial award terminates all future eligibility\n\n\n\n\nFAQ\u2019s\n\nQ. When will the CTG be awarded?\nA. The Financial Aid Office will verify eligibility as of the Enrollment Freeze Date, which is after the add/drop period.\n\n\nQ. My bill is due at the beginning of the semester - I need to know if I qualify for CTG before then.\nA. CTG funds will not be awarded by the tuition due date each term and students should not expect funds prior to late fees being assessed. In addition to verifying each student\u2019s enrollment after the Enrollment Freeze date, the Financial Aid Office must wait for final funding approval from SCHEV. Once funding has been confirmed the Financial Aid Office must review students for eligibility and submit a roster and invoice to SCHEV for approval. This process often results in funds being awarded as late as October (fall) and March (spring).\n\n\nQ. Do I need to submit an application for the CTG?\nA. While not required, it is strongly recommended that students who wish to be considered for the CTG complete the application for the Virginia Two-Year College Transfer Grant. Submission of the application speeds up the review time for students who wish to be considered for funding. Without an application we cannot guarantee that a student will be reviewed as the application alerts the Financial Aid Office to review your record for missing requirements.\n\nThe CTG application can be found at: https://www.schev.edu/financial-aid/financial-aid/federal-state-financial-aid/two-year-college-transfer-grant.\u00a0The application may be submitted in-person at the Mason Student Services Center or online at mssc.gmu.edu, Virtual Services, Document Drop-Off.\n\n\nQ. I just submitted my CTG application. Can I get a status update or an idea of whether I might be eligible?\nA. No. Students are not reviewed for eligibility until after the Enrollment Freeze date. Please refer to the CTG eligibility criteria listed above.\u00a0\n\n\nQ. I do not have an Associate\u2019s Degree but I was awarded a Certificate from my Community College. Can I be considered for the CTG?\nA. No. The CTG requires an earned Associate\u2019s Degree from a VA Two Year College. A Certificate does not fulfill that requirement.\n\n\nQ. Should I submit my final Community College transcript to the Office of Admissions, Financial Aid or both?\nA. Please send your final transcript electronically, to the Office of Admissions. Doing so allows transcript access by both the Office of Admissions and Financial Aid.\n\nApplicants with Northern Virginia Community College transcripts are required to send a Parchment transcript. The Office of Admissions will not accept a paper transcript.\n\n\u00a0\nTranscripts from other institutions must be transmitted directly from the Registrar at your previous school(s) to the George Mason University Office of Admissions at ugtrans@gmu.edu.\n\n\nQ. I submitted my final Community College transcript to the Office of Admissions. I am now being told that it is not considered final.\nA. Final transcripts must display your graduation date and degree earned or they will not be considered final. Note that an earned Associate\u2019s Degree is required. A Certificate does not meet eligibility requirements.\n\n\nQ. What happens if I am awarded a CTG but my balance is already paid in full?\nA. If the disbursement of a CTG creates a credit on your student account, those funds will be issued to you as a refund. It is strongly recommended that you sign up for direct deposit of refunds at X.\n\n\nQ. Are CTG funds awarded in the summer?\nA. No. CTG funds are only awarded in the fall and spring terms.\n\n\nQ. I was awarded CTG funds but one of my other grants was reduced. Why?\nA. Just like the CTG, the Commonwealth Grant and Virginia Guaranteed Assistance Program (VGAP) are funded by the State of Virginia.\u00a0 SCHEV limits the total amount of VA grant funding that a student may receive. Based on a grant equity formula supplied by the State of VA, the Financial Aid Office may need to reduce existing State funding to prevent an over award of aid.\n\n\nQ. I was told I am not eligible for the CTG. Can I appeal that decision?\nA. No. As requirements are determined by the State, the Financial Aid Office is not able to make exceptions for funding eligibility requirements.\u00a0\n\n\nQ. Where can I find additional information about the CTG?\nA. Additional information can be found at https://www.schev.edu/financial-aid/financial-aid/federal-state-financial-aid/two-year-college-transfer-grant.",

This is determined by the information you provide on your FAFSA.\u00a0 If information on the FAFSA changes from year to year, your award may also change.\u00a0 State grants and some institutional funds are limited and\u00a0you must meet the priority filing deadline each year to be considered\u00a0for those funds.\u00a0 Additional reasons why your award may change from year to year include:\n\u00a0\n\nThe cost of education may change\n\nYour family\u2019s income may change\n\nYour student loan eligibility may change as you continue through school\n\nThe number of children in college or your household size reported on your FAFSA may change\n\nYou forget to reapply for financial aid and miss\u00a0the FAFSA priority filing date\n\nThe amount of available funding changes",

			"question": "QUESTION\nWhy is my federal loan amount less than I accepted?",
			"answer": "ANSWER\nMost federal student loans have loan fees that are a percentage of the total loan amount. The loan fee is deducted proportionately from each loan disbursement you receive while enrolled in school. This means the money you receive will be less than the amount you actually borrow. You\u2019re responsible for repaying the entire amount you borrowed and not just the amount you received. Visit studentaid.gov for current loan fee percentages.",

			"question": "QUESTION\nIs there a limit to the amount of Pell Grant awards I can receive?",
			"answer": "ANSWER\nThe amount of Federal Pell Grant funds you may receive over your lifetime is limited by federal law to be the equivalent of six years of Pell Grant funding. Since the amount of a scheduled Pell Grant award you can receive each award year is equal to 100%, the six-year equivalent is 600%.\n\nIf your LEU equals or exceeds 600%, you may no longer receive Pell Grant funding. Similarly, if your LEU is greater than 500% but less than 600%, while you will be eligible for a Pell Grant for the next award year, you will not be able to receive a full scheduled award.\n\nFor additional information and to view your LEU percentage, visit Student Aid Pell LEU.",

			"question": "QUESTION\nWhat is Gender Inclusive Housing?",
			"answer": "ANSWER\n\nGender Inclusive housing\u00a0is sometimes referred to as \u2018GI\u2019 or \u2018CoEd\u2019 housing. Living in Gender Inclusive housing means that you could share a bedroom with someone who identifies as a different gender identity than you. You will be asked in your housing application if you are requesting gender inclusive housing. If you answer\u2019 yes\u2019, you are agreeing to live with any student who is also requesting gender inclusive housing, regardless of gender identity. This means that you would select/be assigned to a CoEd space on campus.\n\nGender Inclusive does not refer to residence hall floors. Most floors on campus are CoEd, regardless of whether the room or suite/apartment is gender inclusive. Students who do NOT select GI will only share a bathroom with the same gender identity.\n\nStudents are required to agree to a set of statements and watch a video within the application to show they have read and understood the terms of GI housing before proceeding with the application. Once application completed (or after May 1st for first-year freshmen) students cannot change their gender inclusive answer.",

			"question": "QUESTION\nI have questions about using my VMSDEP benefits at Mason.",
			"answer": "ANSWER\nVMSDEP (Virginia Military Survivors and Dependent Education Program) is a Commonwealth of Virginia Program which provides education benefits to spouses and children of military service members killed, missing in action, taken prisoner, or who became totally and permanently disabled or at least 90 percent permanently disabled as a result of military service in covered military combat.\n\nBenefits:\n\nTuition/Fee Waiver -\u00a0Eligible students, as confirmed by DVS, are guaranteed waiver of all tuition and required fees for four academic years or the equivalent. The Student Accounts Office applies the tuition waiver to the student's account.\u00a0\n\nStipend -\u00a0Eligible students may receive a stipend to offset other educational expenses. SCHEV works with DVS and the public colleges and universities in disbursing funds for authorized stipend. The amount of the stipend is determined annually by SCHEV and is dependent on the student's enrollment status; the number of participating students; and the available funding. The Mason Financial Aid Office processes the stipend which is then issued to the student as a refund.\u00a0\n\nDepending on the tier that the student falls into, they may be eligible for the tuition waiver only (tier 1) or the waiver and the stipend (tier 2). Students who have already applied and received their confirmation from DVS should know which tier they fall into.\u00a0\n\nStudents may\u00a0file the\u00a0VMSDEP application\u00a0online through the\u00a0Virginia Department of Military Services, which also has complete information about the program and its requirements.\n\nThe Mason Office of Military Services can assist with answering student questions related to the benefit and providing details for using the VMSDEP Portal.\n\nNote that Mason\u00a0must receive approval either in the portal or directly from DVS before the tuition benefit (exemption) can be applied to the student's account.",

This form is a request to use your benefit in a given semester, and must be filled out and submitted before the first day of class in each semester you wish to use your benefit. The first VRRF you submit each semester is a \u201cNew Request\u201d. Changes to your class schedule should be submitted as \u201cChange to Previous Registration\u201d in the drop-down menu. If your schedule does change, we also ask that you provide a brief description of that adjustment to your schedule in the \u201cAdditional Comments\u201d box. Submitting a VRRF will generate an automated confirmation to your Mason e-mail account; if you do not receive that e-mail, please contact the Office of Military Services to verify your submission.\n\nPlease note that VRRFs are processed in the order they are received, so earlier submission of your initial request is always preferred.",

			"answer": "ANSWER\nWith the exception of a complete withdrawal by a student in the Armed Forces who is called to active duty and assigned to a duty station (see below), there is no process to appeal tuition and fees with the Student Accounts Office.\n\nAs such, students are strongly encouraged to consider purchasing Tuition Insurance through GradGuard.\n\nGradGuard\u2019s Tuition Protection Insurance Plan helps students and their families overcome the financial losses, including tuition and housing, that may result from events which force students to withdraw from the semester due to a covered medical reason. The deadline to purchase tuition insurance each term is up until the last day to add classes for the full semester. Visit Tuition Insurance for additional information.\n\nA student in the Armed Forces who is called to active duty and assigned to a duty station, verifiable by a copy of Official Military Orders, will be allowed to receive a 100% reduction of tuition charges after a complete withdrawal is approved for classes that have not been completed. Requests should be sent to saccount@gmu.edu and should include student Gnumber with submission. Requests will not be considered beyond the end of term in which the student completely withdraws.",

Keep in mind that most of these lenders require a US co-signer.\nProdigy Finance: Prodigy Finance is a private loan lender option for International, DACA, and undocumented students. This loan does not require a U.S. co-signer however, interest rates are higher without a U.S. cosigner.\nMPower Financing: MPower Financing is a private loan lender option for International, DACA, and undocumented students as it does not require a U.S. co-signer. Eligibility criteria includes students being within two years of graduation.\u00a0\nMason Scholarship: Consider completing the Mason Scholarship Application for the upcoming academic year. Applications usually open every February for the next academic year.\nOutside Scholarships: It is recommended that you apply for twenty scholarships for every one that you hear back from. This is mainly because they are very competitive. We also suggest applying for outside scholarships in November/December for the next academic year.\nMason Schools/Colleges/Units: Some of Mason\u2019s schools and colleges administer separate funds for their respective enrolled students which may have different criteria for funding consideration. Check with your school or college to find out about their scholarship process.\n\nAdditional information can be found\u00a0here.",

Students will be billed by Mason for any amount due to the University as a result of Title IV funds that were returned that would have been used to cover University charges.\n\n\nPlease note that Mason uses the same return policy for state grants as is required for federal funds.\n\u00a0\n\nIf you are considering dropping or withdrawing from all your courses, please contact your Financial Aid Counselor immediately regarding possible adjustments to your financial aid.\n\nAdditional information may be found on the Office of Student Financial Aid website .",

			"question": "QUESTION\nWhat is Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP)?",
			"answer": "ANSWER\nStudents must maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) in order to remain eligible for financial aid. Academic progress of financial aid recipients is reviewed annually. For the majority of students, this occurs at the conclusion of spring semester. Students in the fully on-line graduate programs taught in 8 week modules will have their progress reviewed at the end of FALL semester. After the review, students who do not meet minimum SAP requirements will be ineligible for financial aid and placed on financial aid suspension.\u00a0\n\nAcademic progress is measured in three ways:\n\u00a0\nQuantitative Standard\u00a0(Completion Rate). This standard requires all students to complete at least 67% of the credits they have attempted. This is calculated by dividing the number of completed credits by the number of attempted credits.\u00a0 Attempted credits include both those earned at Mason and those transferred into Mason.\u00a0 For instance, if a student has attempted 70 credits and completed 62, the student is passing the quantitative standard (62/70 = 88.6%). If a student attempted 15 credits and passed only 6, the student has failed the quantitative standard (6/15 = 40%).\n\u00a0\nTime Frame\u00a0\u2013 All students must complete their program of study by attempting no more than 150% of the hours normally required for completion. For instance, if an undergraduate is expected to complete the degree requiring 120 credits, the student can attempt no more than 180 credits before they fail SAP for Time Frame. Please note, transfer credits brought into Mason count as attempted credits.\n\u00a0\nQualitative Standard\u00a0- All students must meet minimum GPA standards, depending on their level (Undergraduate, Graduate, Law)\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0a. Starting with Fall 2022, undergraduate students must maintain a cumulative GPA of at least 2.0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0b. Graduate and doctoral students must maintain a cumulative GPA of at least 3.0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0c. Law students must maintain a cumulative GPA of at least 2.15\n\nPlease visit the Financial Aid website for additional SAP information, including SAP Appeal based on mitigating circumstances.",

			"answer": "ANSWER\nIf the parent is entering their information and they are unable to create an account, the student/parent should confirm the following:\n\n1) Is the parent entering the information exactly as it appears on the FAFSA?\nCheck the First Initial and Last Name on the FAFSA for extra spaces, special characters, or suffixes\nIf the FAFSA contains any of these in the last name, they\u00a0must be entered exactly the same in the create account screen\n2) \u00a0Does the SSN entered for the parent match the information provided on the FAFSA?\nThe SSN should be entered\u00a0without\u00a0dashes(hyphens) or spaces\nIf the parent is copying and pasting the SSN into the field and is unable to create an account, they may want to type the SSN into the field\n(Typing in the SSN instead of copying/pasting helps to avoid copying extra spaces or dashes that should not be entered in the SSN field)\n2) Has the student sent the e-sign request to the parent?\nIf the student has requested the e-signature from the parent, the e-sign request step in the student's Patriot Forms account will show text to indicate that the e-signature has been requested.\nIf the student has not requested the e-signature, the step will indicate that the signature request has not been initiated.\u00a0\n3) Only the parent that the student selects on the e-signature request screen will be able to create an account.\nIf the parent not selected in the request screen tries to create an account using their information, they will receive an error.\nIf they need to send the signature request to the other parent listed they may do so in the edit request button.\nThe parent can only access the Create Parent Account page from the link that is sent through the request from the student. If the parents both have the same first initial and last name, the student may need to edit the request and send it to the other parent listed.",
